# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
# Multi-stage build for the BoondManager MCP server.
# The runtime image starts the Streamable HTTP transport, suitable for use as
# an MCP gateway (LobeChat, custom MCP host, etc.). For stdio usage, prefer
# `npx boondmanager-mcp-server` directly on the host — Docker's stdio mapping
# is awkward and you don't gain anything by containerising it.
#
# Authentication model (HTTP transport): the MCP server is an OAuth2
# *protected resource*. It holds **no secrets**: no client_secret, no
# refresh token, no token store. Each MCP request from the client must
# carry `Authorization: Bearer <boond_access_token>`; the server forwards
# the token verbatim to BoondManager. The client (Claude Desktop, Claude
# Code, MCP gateway, …) performs the OAuth dance against BoondManager
# directly and refreshes its own tokens.
#
# The server publishes RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata at
# `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` so MCP clients auto-discover
# the BoondManager authorization server.
#
# See docs/oauth.md for the full flow.

# Pinned by multi-arch index digest for reproducible, tamper-evident builds.
# Dependabot (docker ecosystem) keeps the digest fresh as `24-alpine` moves.
#
# Base image policy (issue #246): the **active LTS** line, never "current".
# Node 24 is LTS since October 2025; Node 26 only becomes LTS in October 2026
# and was what the image shipped on. Bump the major here when the next line
# enters Active LTS (see README-docker.md § Image de base).
