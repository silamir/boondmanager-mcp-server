// than a route's ceiling, the apiSearch layer fetches it in chunks of that size
// and merges the pages, so the caller still gets the full page while we never
// send maxResults above the cap. A route absent from this map uses

//
//   /poles      HTTP 200, 73 rows  (meta.totals.rows 73)
//   /agencies   HTTP 200, 11 rows  (meta.totals.rows 11)
//   /calendars  HTTP 200, 249 rows (no meta.totals.rows)
//   /webhooks   HTTP 200, 3 rows   (meta.totals.rows 3)
//
// The server does send the parameter; BoondManager discards it on these
// reference routes. So `pageSize` and `page` are inert there, and a description
// promising "`pageSize` 1–500, `page` 1–100 — beyond that: rejected" would be
// telling a model something the endpoint does not do. That is the same class of
// defect as the hand-typed "défaut: 20, max: 100" this catalogue just removed,
// so these tools get their own wording instead (see `parameter-disclosure.ts`).
//
// Keyed by tool name, not API path: the disclosure runs in the registration
// Proxy, which sees the tool name and the schema, never the `apiPath`.
//
// Not an operational risk, and worth saying so: these are small reference
// tables (3–249 rows, ~18 KB of tool result at the largest) — far under
// CHARACTER_LIMIT. The problem is accuracy, not volume.
//
// Deliberately *not* extended by guesswork. `/business-units`, `/products`,
// `/threads` and `/todolists` returned 0 rows on the tenant probed, so their
// behaviour is unknown; a route belongs here only once it has been observed
// returning more rows than it was asked for.
